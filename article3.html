                One response to our question is to maintain that suffering has <i>instrumental</i> value for participants and spectators. 
                One form that this takes is in the provision of strength, since by suffering physically, our bodies can grow stronger. 
                This is the principle behind muscle growth, which involves the damage and subsequent repair and strengthening of muscle fibres. 
                Similarly, vaccination involves exposure to disease and temporary weakness, so that one becomes strong enough to resist it and healthier as a result.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-cloud">
                And the idea has obvious application when it comes to sporting participation. Athletes willingly embrace the 
                pain and suffering of physical exercise in order to build muscles, stamina, and endurance. Overcoming physical adversity has clear 
                psychological benefits as well: one learns how to persevere, develops the psychological strength and fortitude to keep going when things are tough, 
                becomes the kind of character that welcomes and embraces difficulties and challenges. Suffering has instrumental value from an epistemological standpoint too: 
                through suffering, athletes can come to know the limits of their bodies; novice boxers learn that being hit doesn&apos;t hurt as much as they feared it would; 
                teams learn about, and from, disappointment and failure. As Sir Alex Ferguson, former Manchester United manager, put things: 
                “You learn more from defeats than you do from victories.” (It was no surprise to those who had followed Ferguson&apos;s managerial career that after United 
                lost the Premier League title on goal difference to Manchester City in 2012, they won the 2013 title by 11 points.)
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-cloud">
                When it comes to spectators and fans, suffering can also have clear instrumental value. Perhaps the main way in which this can happen is by 
                enabling us to fully <i>appreciate</i> sporting values and achievements. 
                One important set of such values are those that <i>contrast</i> with suffering. It might, for instance, be true that we can only really understand or 
                grasp the value of something if we have experience of its opposite: so we might only fully appreciate the goodness of a warm house and a full stomach 
                if we have been cold, homeless, and hungry; we only fully appreciate love and companionship after we have experienced heartbreak and loneliness.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-cloud">
                The claim that suffering is necessary for such appreciation and understanding can itself be understood in two ways.
                On one reading, the claim is that the experience of certain pleasures requires the experience of suffering, since the pleasure itself can be defined 
                simply in terms of <i>relief from</i> suffering. Think, for instance, of the relief one gets when one no longer suffers toothache, or when a neighbour&apos;s loud 
                music finally stops, or when one scratches that really irritating itch. As the psychologists Siri Leknes and Brock Bastian note: “The contrast afforded by 
                pain and other aversive experiences is closely associated with the subjective experience of relief.” And: “Pain affords an effective contrast to many 
                non-painful experiences, which can appear relatively pleasant or rewarding if they occur after the pain has ended. For instance, fruit flies approached 
                odours associated with pain offset even when these odours were initially mildly aversive … Similar effects have been observed in rats … and humans.” 
                Some of these humans will be sports fans. Think, for instance, of the relief that Cleveland Browns fans felt after their team won for the first time in 
                635 days, following two seasons of misery, frustration, disappointment, and humiliation.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Row 2 -->
    <div class="cloud-row speed-2">
        <div class="cloud-track">
            <div class="paragraph-cloud">
                On a second reading, the claim is that a prior experience of suffering <i>intensifies</i> our experience of some value..., so that the latter 
                is experienced as more pleasant as a result. The pleasure of cold beer is heightened and intensified if one is thirsty and overheated on a blistering day. 
                Here are Leknes and Bastian again: “Although introspection suggests to many people that relief and pleasure are easily dissociated, most primary rewards are 
                intensified by relief. Food and drink taste better when providing relief from hunger or thirst … And where would the pleasure in going to bed at night be 
                if we were not so tired, our muscles weary and aching?”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-cloud">
                This too has obvious parallels for sporting fans. The pleasure that Boston Red Sox fans experienced when their team won the baseball 
                World Series in 2004 was surely intensified by the fact that the team had not won it since 1918; many Red Sox fans had known nothing but despair and 
                disappointment for their lifetime following the team. (The run of near-misses in that time is so notable that some thought, not entirely in jest, 
                that the club was “cursed” after trading Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees in 1919.) Here too suffering would seem to have clear instrumental value for 
                spectators and fans.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-cloud">
                However, these (and other) forms of instrumental goodness do not exhaust the value that suffering can have for players and 
                spectators of sport. This is because many of the instances described in the previous section—where people voluntarily engage in sporting activities 
                that involve pain and suffering—are not cases where people do so to make themselves stronger or fitter, or because their pleasure will thereby be 
                intensified or enhanced. It is implausible to suppose that endurance runners and boxers and golfers and cyclists and hockey players embrace challenges 
                and difficulties, and the pain and suffering that are part and parcel of these, <i>only because</i> these are a way to get fitter and stronger, physically and 
                psychologically. Nor is it the case that those who engage in these sporting activities always do so because of the pleasures of relief when the suffering stops, 
                or because the suffering promises to make the good times even better.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Row 3 -->
    <div class="cloud-row speed-3">
        <div class="cloud-track">
            <div class="paragraph-cloud">
                While there is such a thing as runner's high, and intense pleasure in hitting a five-iron perfectly after a run of poor shots, 
                endurance runners and golfers don&apos;t embrace challenge and difficulty for these hedonistic reasons alone either. This is because runners and golfers would 
                still embrace difficulty and suffering even if it didn&apos;t have these hedonistic benefits. In other words: it is not the case that participants only embrace 
                pain and suffering because this will improve their skills and performance, and/or because it promises to make the good times better—
                although it is doubtless true that pain and suffering will have these positive effects in many cases. Instead, those who play and participate in sports 
                often seem to regard suffering as a condition on the value of what they do; they think that suffering partly defines the value of their activity, 
                in much the same way that difficulty is a condition on the attraction of philosophical puzzles or video games, and sacrifice a condition on the worth of 
                religious devotion and musical performance. These attitudes don&apos;t seem to be explicable in terms of obvious instrumental benefits like increased strength or 
                intensified pleasure.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-cloud">
                A similar point can be made about the motivations of fans and spectators. Football supporters, say, clearly put up with all
                kinds of pain and suffering—related to the weather, cost of tickets, poor transport, terrible grounds, risible treatment by authorities, 
                the contempt of other fans, the indifference of their own players, etc.—for the sake of their team. They also doubtless sometimes think that bad times 
                enhance the good in the ways explained earlier. But these are not the only motivations that fans have to endure and embrace suffering. 
                Instead, suffering is sometimes viewed as part of what it is <i>to be</i> a fan. Here again suffering is embraced as a condition on the value of being a supporter. 
                If things were too easy, comfortable, organized, and fun; if one&apos;s team were too successful, the opposing fans too respectful, 
                the media and authorities too supportive; then I suspect that many supporters would lose interest in their team. 
                It&apos;s not that pain and suffering are therefore the price one pays for being a fan, or that they make the occasional good times even better—although again, 
                these things are clearly true a lot of the time. Instead, pain and suffering are part of what being a fan or supporter is all about.
