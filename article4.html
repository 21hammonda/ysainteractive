    <p class="track">
      The running industry conveys many notions that are camouflaged into our daily lives. Examples of such notions include: that there is one narrow, predetermined definition of beauty or masculinity, the endurance of pain and sacrifice is natural, individuals are responsible for their own success, the existence of winners and losers is normal, competition leads to peak performance, choice is always positive, time is equivalent to money, success is quantifiable and rules should be unquestionably followed. The late George Sheehan, M.D. (1992), an avid runner, cardiologist, and running author, wrote “[t]he more I run, the more I live a life conditioned and influenced and fashioned by my running” (p. 4). Capitalist and neoliberal ideologies influence marketing, advertising, race events, and other media forms, which communicate these messages to running consumers.

    <div class="bib">Predetermined Definition of Beauty and Masculinity</div>

    <p class="track">
      In running and in most advertising in general society's narrow definition of beauty is easily identified. This definition must be limited, in order to be more marketable to the masses. Companies associated with running products or services tend to display various pictures of serious, muscular, and cut men along with happy, slim, and toned women. One of the many advertisements on <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com">Runner's World</a>’s website shows a young brunette woman with slight smile. She is posing with her hands on her hips, exposing her slim arms and toned abs. She looks confident and is wearing a black sports bra. The caption reads “Innovative jog bras that hold up to the test.” If they are truly attempting to sell a runner a jog bra to run in, then why is the bra not shown alone? Or if the purpose of showing it on a person is to show how it would fit, would it not make more sense to show the bra on a more average body? Although this strategy is not exclusive to running, perhaps, the goal is not to accurately display how the running top would look on the consumer and how it might meet the consumers' actual needs or expectations, but to sell the athletic physique along with the sports bra. Thus the picture is actually suggesting that by making this purchase, the consumer could look like the model, exuding her poise and satisfaction.

    <div class="bib">Endurance of Pain & Sacrifice, Individual Responsibility, Winners & Losers</div>

    <p class="track">
      The running industry also naturalizes the idea of sacrifice and pain as necessary modes for achievement. One of the Runner's World books (sold on their online store), <em>The Runner's Body</em> is marketed as an aid to assist with the “stress of running” (Dugas, Fitzgerald, & Tucker, 2009). Dr. George Sheehan an avid runner, author and physician wrote that “[r]unning provides that self-control, that discipline. It teaches about pain and guilt. But it also demands logic and teaches how results are obtained” (Sheehan, 1992, p. 211). These statements indicate that success is obtained through hard work, sacrifice, and the individual is exclusively responsible for that success. Others can help motivate, support, and advise runners, but it all comes down to the runner to push him or herself to the front of the pack. This individualistic mindset is also a component of capitalism. Capitalism encourages responsibility to lie on individual's shoulders; so if someone is not successful then it is not the system's fault, but the individual's defect for being lazy or incompetent. The connection between sport and individualism was also seen in Ancient Greece during the early Olympics, “[n]ational competitiveness plunged the land into endless warfare, and was reflected within each city on a daily basis - not just in the chaotic internal politics of most states, but by the flamboyant individualism of its citizens” (Perrottett, 2004, p. 19).
    </p>
    <p class="track">
      Ideals regarding the association between pain and sacrifice for achievement and individual responsibility for success go hand in hand with the normalization of the concept that both winners and losers should exist. In races and in life ideas regarding winning and losing are associated with effort level. Excerpts from the following article discuss keys or crucial race strategies to win:
    </p>
    <ol class="track">
      <li>“By running an even pace, you'll gradually catch runners who started the race too fast. Catching and passing other runners during the race will give you a psychological lift, and will weigh heavily on the other runners” (Pfitzinger, 1998, para. 8)</li>
      <li>“…steadily passing other runners as they wilted in the heat” (Pfitzinger, 1998, para. 6).</li>
      <li>“Controlling pace is the key to effective training and essential to winning” (Ruth, 1999, para. 1)</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="track">
      These ideas coincide with the existence of successful and unsuccessful citizens or rich and poor consumers, equating their circumstances to their effort level rather than other factors such as privilege and discrimination based on race, sexuality, socio-economic class, or gender. Sports or jock culture are omnipresent in our society - the attitudes and codes are woven into medicine, law, and big business. Society labels “winners and losers… [and they are treated as] stars or slugs by coachlike authority figures who use shame and intimidation to achieve short-term results.” (Lipsyte, 2011, p. 12). This is not limited to fields of study or industry more commonly associated with completion, but also includes “symphony orchestras, university philosophy departments and liberal magazines” (Lipsyte, 2011, p.12). For economic reasons, winners are often redefined as “everyone who gets out there and tries” or “everyone who completes the race,” otherwise race registration and, therefore, profit would be negatively affected. But notions that normalize the subsistence of winners and losers and that winning corresponds to individual hard work alone essentially reinforce ideals that everyone receives equal treatment and opportunity and furthermore, that the past does not impact the present.

    <div class="bib">Rules Should Be Unquestionably Followed</div>

    <p class="track">
      Rules are central to racing. Before the race even begins, runners are required to pick up a packet at a designated time and location. This packet pickup process is intentionally drawn out. The runner must go through a maze of booths designed to sell running foods, apparels, and other related products. The runner must enter and exit through this vendor maze in order to receive a packet, which usually contains a bib number, timing chip, t-shirt (swathed in sponsorship company logos) and tens to hundreds of advertisements. On race day, runners begin at a specified location and time, where they are able to stand in lines to check their bags or utilize specified port-a-potties. Faster runners receive corral benefits such as shorter gear check-in and port-a-potty lines and get to begin the race closer to the starting line (which also helps the flow of the race at the beginning by organizing runners based on pace). Runners are usually required to wear a bib number to identify themselves as racers and consumers, as these numbers help the race photography company to identify and in turn sell the runner photographs throughout the race.
    </p>
    <p class="track">
      Then runners must follow a designated course, where eating, drinking, and going to the restroom is designated in assigned areas. Once they complete the race they enter another line to receive their reward, which is sometimes the opportunity to be a walking advertisement via a medal with the race sponsor company's logo prominently displayed. Runners then enter another line to have their picture taken. For years after the race is over, the runner will receive emails compelling them to buy the picture as a necessary souvenir recognizing their accomplishment. If runners do not follow these rules they can be physically removed from the race or their legs might be stamped, labeling them as disqualified. How did running become such a process, involving so many rules? “We must never forget that what we do is tainted and distorted, inevitably, by the awe of expertise that is induced by social institutions as one device for enforcing passivity and obedience” (Chomsky, 2002, p. 119). The rule following and submission required in races translates into other areas such as the employment and education domains. Sports can be used to normalize social structures and ideas of resolute allegiance and to educate others' where power lies. “[S]port is conceived as a training in courage and manliness, 'forming the character' and inculcating the 'will to win' which is the mark of the true leader, but a will to win within rules” (Bourdieu, 1978, p. 824).

    <p class="track">
      Corporate principles and catchphrases are also making their way into other aspects of life, which shows the magnitude and span of capitalist corporate ideologies, such as the equation of time to money and the normalization of the existence of winners and losers is natural. The Times article “Person of the Year - Runners Up” described a man with great discipline and success:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="track quote">
      In 1982 a freshly minted army captain named Stanley McChrystal arrived at Fort Stewart, Ga., and was invited for a run by a more experienced captain named David Petraeus..."I took a lot of pride in my running," the general [Petraeus] told me recently. In fact, Petraeus famously was, and remains, a fitness fanatic. "But by the end of the run, I knew I was no longer the fastest at Fort Stewart. More important, we had talked about a lot of things, and I realized that I had met a kindred spirit'…The two men are similar in many ways. Both are fierce ascetics — McChrystal eats one meal per day and sleeps four hours per night — and both are military intellectuals. (Gregory, “General Stanley McChrystal,” 2009, para. 1)
    </blockquote>
    <p class="track">
      Eating one meal each day is not promoted by the United States Department of Agriculture or the vast majority of the medical community, but this article paints this type of commitment to work, efficiency, and productivity as positive, and links dedicated, regimented running as a means to get there.
    </p>
    <p class="track">
      This message is not limited to military-centered articles and running-specific magazines, the New York Times published an article earlier this year quoting NPR's 'Wait Wait…Don't Tell Me' host, Peter Sagal: “What is it about the pain of endurance sports that's fun?” he asked me. He added that when asked why he keeps running races, “I say...um...because the pain is sort of the point? Because it's good to push yourself to the point of breaking?” (Kolata, 2011, para. 2). The message that pushing yourself towards imminent destruction is always positive, pain is necessary, and competition leads to success is common in running guides and popular culture (as evidenced in the following analyses).
