      <p>Political decisions and even the tone and culture of debate have consequences 
         that reach into <b>every</b> aspect of society ‚Äî including the world of sports.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-box" id="box2">
      <p>Running may seem disconnected from such debates, but it is not. 
         The values we uphold in our running communities reflect the values we uphold 
         in the wider world.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-box" id="box3">
      <p>Inevitably, however, someone will chime in with the all-too-familiar phrase:

      <p>Running is an activity that brings people together, builds communities,

      <p>Also, simply ignoring politics in running is a privilege that many do not have.</p>

        <li>Who can run freely in public spaces without being attacked?</li>
        <li>Who has access to safe running facilities?</li>

        <li>Who is judged at the starting line because they don‚Äôt have the money for the latest shoes?</li>

    <div class="text-box" id="box7">
      <p>SPECIAL EFFECT: <br>These are inherently political questions. Pretending otherwise 
         is not neutrality ‚Äî it is a choice to ignore the structures that create inclusion 
         for some and exclusion for others.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-box" id="box8">
      <p>Yes, I believe that the running community has the potential to be a powerful force 
         for positive change. A space where meaningful debate opens hearts and minds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-box" id="box9">
      <p>Where solidarity extends beyond the high five after a run, and where peaceful coexistence 
         of different backgrounds, beliefs, and identities is practiced every day. 
         Running together makes a statement. It proves that diversity is not a threat, but a strength.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-box" id="box10">
      <p>Now, more than ever, is the time to be loud and visible. To open this space for debate and exchange. Silence is death.</p>
      <p>So speak your mind. State your values. Stand up to injustice whenever and wherever you see it. 
         And never let anyone tell you that there is no place for political discourse in running. There is.</p>
