        <div class="letter-body">
            <p>It is difficult to pick out the events in one&apos;s past that would be of interest to anyone who does not know me personally. </p>
            <p>My great grandparents and even my grandparents were pioneers. They pushed toward the setting sun dreaming of a better world in which they and their families could live in peace. They knew they could achieve greatness if they were willing to work for it. The true spirit of the pioneer is expressed in these simple words by Zane Grey: </p>
            <p>"To bear up under loss—to fight the bitterness of defeat and the weakness of grief—to be victor over anger—to smile when tears are close—to resist evil men and base instincts—to hate hate and love love—to go on when it would seem good to die—to seek ever after the glory and dream—to look up with unquenchable faith in something ever more about to be—that is what any man can do, and so be great."</p>
            <p>Why is it I, having such heritage as this cannot seem to do more with the opportunities I have, which they did not have? I, just as the pioneers, would like to find a better world to live in. </p>
            <p>My brother, being the only boy among four girls, I have always felt, was spoiled a little more than the other children in our family. During my childhood I was sometimes distressed over the popularity of my older brother and at times even jealous of him. I realize now, I, being the oldest of four sisters, that I was probably just as spoiled. In fact I suppose we each had our turn at being “spoiled” since we were born four years apart. </p>
            <p>I did have one advantage over the rest though, because my father&apos;s parents never had any daughters and when I came along as the first granddaughter, I was “just it.”</p>
            <p>When I was eleven years old, I joined a 4H Club. I still have several things in my “hope chest” that I made while a member of 4H.</p>
            <p>And then there were my classes of cooking and sewing in the seventh and eighth grade which every girl was required to take. Unlike some of the girls, I really enjoyed these classes. </p>
            <p>Much of my training, however, came from my grandmother. Every summer she sent for me to visit her in Calif. She was bedridden and I did most of the chores. She was an excellent cook and housekeeper and I feel very fortunate to have been able to have her help and directions.</p>
            <p>I was even with my grandmother when she died, and that was not a pleasant experience for a thirteen year old girl. </p>
            <p>When I graduated from High School I didn&apos;t want to attend college because I was “Tired of school.” However when fall came I found myself registering at Phoenix College of my own free will. I wasn&apos;t sure just what I wanted to prepare for while there, but I was sure I wanted more education.</p>
            <p>I am still continuing my study in Home Economics and I find the field more interesting and fascinating every day. My goal as far as securing a living is concerned, is to become a Home Economics teacher.</p>
            <p>My goal other than my occupation is to live a good life, treat my fellow man with kindness and understanding, and help to make the world a better place in which future generations can live in peace and harmony.</p>
